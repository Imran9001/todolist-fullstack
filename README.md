Full-Stack To-Do List Application

A modern, responsive full-stack To-Do List application, enabling users to efficiently manage their tasks. This project demonstrates proficiency in building robust web applications from end-to-end, featuring a React frontend, a Node.js Express backend with a MongoDB Atlas database, and comprehensive cloud deployment using AWS and Docker. A key focus of this project was ensuring high code quality and reliability through extensive unit testing across both frontend and backend.

Features
Comprehensive Task Management: Developed a full-stack application supporting robust CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for to-do items.

Intuitive User Interface: Engineered a responsive and intuitive user interface using React, employing a component-based architecture and efficient state management (useState, useEffect).

Robust RESTful API: Implemented efficient asynchronous handling (async/await) and comprehensive error management (try-catch blocks) for seamless data operations via a Node.js Express backend.

Cloud-Native & Scalable Deployment: Backend containerized with Docker and deployed on AWS ECS Fargate for a scalable, serverless cloud infrastructure.

Global Frontend Distribution: React frontend hosted on AWS S3 and globally distributed via Amazon CloudFront for high availability and performance.

Custom Domain Integration: Configured and managed DNS records to seamlessly integrate a custom domain (todolist.it.com) with AWS CloudFront.

High-Quality Code Assurance: Achieved 100% unit test coverage for both frontend and backend, covering UI rendering, form validation, API endpoints, database operations, and error handling.

Technologies Used
Frontend:

React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

HTML5 / CSS3: Standard web technologies for structure and styling.

State Management: React Hooks (useState, useEffect) for managing component state.

Backend:

Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment.

Express.js: Fast, minimalist web framework for Node.js.

MongoDB Atlas: Cloud-hosted NoSQL database service.

Mongoose ODM: MongoDB object data modeling for Node.js, including schema definition with data validation.

Containerization & Cloud Deployment:

Docker: Platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.

AWS ECS Fargate: Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) with Fargate, a serverless compute engine for containers.

AWS S3: Amazon Simple Storage Service, used for static frontend hosting.

Amazon CloudFront: Content Delivery Network (CDN) service for global content distribution.

Testing:

Jest: A JavaScript Testing Framework used for both frontend and backend unit tests.

React Testing Library: A set of utilities for testing React components in a way that resembles how users interact with the app.

Supertest: A library for testing Node.js HTTP servers/APIs.

Learnings & Key Takeaways
Full-Stack Development Mastery: Gained hands-on experience in orchestrating communication between frontend and backend, and managing database interactions for a seamless user experience.

Advanced Cloud Deployment: Deepened understanding of serverless container deployment with AWS ECS Fargate and global content delivery using AWS S3 and CloudFront.

Robust API Design: Learned best practices for designing RESTful APIs, including efficient asynchronous handling and comprehensive error management strategies.

Test-Driven Quality Assurance: Solidified understanding of the importance of unit testing and achieved high test coverage, ensuring code reliability and maintainability.

Domain & DNS Management: Gained practical experience in configuring custom domains and integrating them with cloud services.
